I am a graduate student in Experimental High Energy Physics working with CMS Experiment at CERN, Geneva. I am based at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai and works with Prof. Kajari Mazumdar. I am a keen enthusiast of computing related fields and I have taken up and delivered many compute intensive projects in my academic career. Recently I have grown interested in Heterogeneous computing using GPUs and FPGAs.

I am very curious about the developments happening in the Machine Learning world and have tried getting my hand dirty in building models and innovative data pipelines. Along with the practical aspects of Machine learning able to fit any function , I am quite intrigued by the question of how this fundamentally be linked to inteligence . In the coming years I would like to work towards getting a better understanding of this problem.
